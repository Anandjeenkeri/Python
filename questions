1) What is PEP 8?
    PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendation, about how to write your Python code more readable.
2) What is pickling and unpickling?
    Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function,
    this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called 
    unpickling.
3) How memory is managed in Python?
    Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap.
    The programmer does not have an access to this private heap and interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.
    The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by Python memory manager. 
    The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
     Python also have an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycle all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space.
     
 4) What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis?
    PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects the bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug. 
    Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard.
 5) What is the difference between Xrange and range?
    Xrange returns the xrange object while range returns the list, and uses the same memory and no matter what the range size is.
